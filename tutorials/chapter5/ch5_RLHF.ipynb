    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) can be used to fine-tune a generative language model. We use a set of prompts that reflect various ways that a human might potentially interact with a chatbot, along with a separate reward model that rates the quality of the generated answers. The reward model outputs are then used to update the weights of the LM through the PPO algorithm. The end result is an updated version of the LM that has been optimized to receive consistently higher returns from the reward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods outlined here are a reflection of key advancements that brought generative AI into the mainstream and stimulated a massive wave of investment. Before RLHF came into prominence with results such as InstructGPT, state-of-the-art LLM's were capable of producing realistic prompt answers with appropriate grammatical usage and accurate factual knowledge. However, these responses often were not well-suited for addressing a problem or completing a task in a useful manner. With the addition of RLHF, LLM's have gained the ability to align their outputs more closely to the intentions of their users. This has opened the door to many new applications that require more human-like interactions than chatbots and virtual assistants were previously capable of. It has also become a major contributor to the latest efforts in AI safety. Bai et al. (2022) did extensive work toward the ideal of \"helpful, honest, and harmless\" LLM interactions developed through RLHF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since RLHF is a very expensive process, in terms of human effort as well as compute resources, the experiment provided in this tutorial follows a much shorter and simpler training process than what would be required to see truly impressive results. But even this small-scale exercise is sufficient to demonstrate how these techniques have been very effective when employed at a much larger scale.\n"

To train this model, we could use a dataset very similar to the one already described. In some cases, rather than only having two answers to compare, the original LLM is instead asked to produce several possible answers. Human annotators must then rank them from best to worst, very much like what is represented as the \"chosen\" and \"rejected\" columns in the Anthropic dataset. This data is then used to train the reward model.\n",

One will remain frozen for use as a reference, while the other will be the initial policy that's iteratively trained with PPO. The resulting policy after training is a new version of the generated model with the weights optimized for better human ratings. In each iteration of the training loop, the following steps occur:\n",
    "1. A batch of prompts is passed through both the policy LLM and the frozen copy.\n",
    "2. The responses from the policy are fed into the reward model to score their quality.\n",
    "3. Gradient descent is used to update the weights with the objective of maximizing the reward. Note that the reward model is typically not an adequate reward function on its own. The construction of the reward function is an active area of research, but it almost always includes KL divergence between the updated policy and the original reference LLM. The goal is to ensure that the policy doesn't overfit to the reward model and forget too much information that it had previously learned."

    "Further possibilities exist beyond the minimalist demonstration of the RLHF process provided above. One possible improvement is that reward models can be continually updated with online data in a system that gives users the option of rating the virtual assistant's answers. This ensures that recent data is readily available to keep the reward model current, and the cost is lower than having to pay people to do the annotation. The tradeoff, however, is that the quality of rankings may not be as consistent."

    "To further examine the gains achieved by the RLHF process, we'll use the perplexity metric which is very commonly used for autoregressive models. It essentially works by referencing a desirable text and then computing the probabilities that the LM could have produced that same sequence of tokens. The result is inverted so that the minimum value is 1.0, and lower scores indicate a better model than higher scores. A nice visual explanation of perplexity can be found here: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perplexity. The HuggingFace `evaluate` library also provides a convenient method for computing perplexity, which is what we use in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our evaluation data, we use the `test` split of the Anthropic dataset that the RL policy was trained on. This will give us similar types of examples, but they are ones that were never seen during the RLHF process. The text from the `chosen` column is supplied to both the original LM and the one that we tuned on the Helpful data. This allows us to compare how well each LM is conditioned to produce the output that a human annotator would consider to be helpful."
