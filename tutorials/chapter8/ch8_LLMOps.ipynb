I am reviewing the details for the delay on DL1234. *AJL \\n Agent: The flight history does indicate the delay was for deicing. Do you have additional information from the pilot what the maintenance was for? *AJL \\n Customer: The pilot announced over the speaker that he apologized for the delay maintenance took to get there and that once they checked out the wings, there was in fact no ice. Once we were able to taxi, he announced we'd have to wait another 5 mins for takeoff line up. \\n Agent: Aimee, all delays are frustrating and I'm sorry that you were affected. We'll try to have you on your way asap. *TLT \\n Customer: Not a great response for what took me 3 flights to try to get where I should've been...especially when it means missed meetings and loss of business. I'm sure Delta wouldn't be happy about that either. #NotASatisfiedCustomer \\n \",\n          \" \\nCustomer: Remember now why I never fly @British_Airways absolutely crap service!

The price for rebooking and transforming return flights in one-way tickets, have to be re-priced 1/2 \\n Agent: based on current availability and ticket rules. Sorry if the cost es higher than you expected. ^Monica 2/2 \\n Customer: Not good enough, as a first class customer I don't even want to use flight 2 and 3 just 1 and 4!!! Absolutely terrible service, won't fly BA \\n Agent: I'm sorry to hear this Hannah. Unfortunately, changing the booking would be against the fare rules. If you fail to make the changes you 1/2 \\n Agent: may have a No Show go into your booking invalidating you tickets.
