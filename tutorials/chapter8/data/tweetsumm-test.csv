 Customer: The Great British Non-Apology: ""we apologise for any inconvenience this might have caused"". Firstly, it's more than a mere inconvenience, it's a major problem. Secondly, at the very least you could have the decency and backbone to admit that it HAS caused, not MIGHT HAVE caused. 
 Customer: Your reply doesn't explain why there hasn't been a single proactive message from BA in your twitter feed about this issue. With a problem of this magnitude and duration you should be giving us information &amp; updates, not only responding to incoming messages. Proactive vs reactive.

### Conversation: 
Customer: Problems with your desktop website? ETA to resolution? How am I supposed to order my in-flight meal? 
 Agent: Hi there, we're aware of the issue and our IT team are working on a fix as we speak. Sorry for the inconvenience. ^Fiona 
 Customer: The fact that you’re not all over this on social media and tweeting updates indicates you’ve not acknowledged the magnitude of yet ANOTHER BA IT failure. ETA to fix?? ? 
 Agent: We appreciate your frustration, however we're unable to provide you with a timescale. Please be assured we're working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and we can only apologise for any inconvenience this might have caused. ^Cody 
 Customer: The Great British Non-Apology: ""we apologise for any inconvenience this might have caused"". Firstly, it's more than a mere inconvenience, it's a major problem. Secondly, at the very least you could have the decency and backbone to admit that it HAS caused, not MIGHT HAVE caused. 
 Customer: Your reply doesn't explain why there hasn't been a single proactive message from BA in your twitter feed about this issue. With a problem of this magnitude and duration you should be giving us information &amp; updates, not only responding to incoming messages. Proactive vs reactive. 
 Agent: If you need to order a meal we can certainly help you with that. You'll need to DM us your full name, booking reference, email address and what number we can reach you on. ^Natalie 
 Customer: Since your reply comes 7 hours after I asked the question, we're now well beyond the 24h cut-off for in-flight meal ordering. Thanks a bunch.

 Customer: Did the cache clearing, and will try uninstall reinstall this evening. 
 Agent: Sounds like a plan! Thanks again for being willing to troubleshoot with us. We'll be on standby for the results. 
 Customer: I tried uninstall/reinstall, so I have been through all the troubleshooting steps. Problem seemed worse actually. There is a hulu uservoice where others are reporting this as well on Fire TV. I suspect it needs a bug fix. 
 Customer: See this: 
 Customer: A month of my subscription fee has now been wasted trying to watch video with this audio delay on your Fire TV app. I'm going to deactivate I think and wait for a version update. 
 Agent: Sorry for the continued trouble, Mark, as we'd hate to see you go! Have you tried connecting your Fire TV to a different HDMI port for comparison? If no change after, please call/chat us so we can take a closer look on our end: 
 Customer: My monitor has only one port. Hulu is the only app with an audio delay, and only since the update to this new look a few weeks back. I also use netflix, crackle, and amazon video with no audio delay. 
 Customer: Monitor is reliable 4K monitor and all video I watch is through FireTV apps. I put my Hulu account on hold. Unless Hulu decides to pay ME to help solve a problem with the hulu FireTV app, I won't spend hrs on the line trying same ineffective troubleshooting I've already done. 
 Customer: If you want more information about my specific setup (FireTV model/version, monitor, things like that... ), and these will be used in-house by QE team to troubleshoot, I could send that. 
 Customer: Here's information you can pass along. Previously, delayed sound occurred with and without bluetooth speaker use. App JUST got a new update on FireTV. Now, audio of HDMI seems ok, but bluetooth audio is delayed. ONLY with the hulu app. 
 Agent: We're glad to hear about the improvement, Mark. We do not support any external audio devices at this stage, which may be why you're having trouble with bluetooth. We'll definitely pass along the interest, though. Let us know if we can assist further.

 Customer: Monitor is reliable 4K monitor and all video I watch is through FireTV apps. I put my Hulu account on hold. Unless Hulu decides to pay ME to help solve a problem with the hulu FireTV app, I won't spend hrs on the line trying same ineffective troubleshooting I've already done. 
 Customer: If you want more information about my specific setup (FireTV model/version, monitor, things like that... ), and these will be used in-house by QE team to troubleshoot, I could send that. 
 Customer: Here's information you can pass along. Previously, delayed sound occurred with and without bluetooth speaker use. App JUST got a new update on FireTV. Now, audio of HDMI seems ok, but bluetooth audio is delayed. ONLY with the hulu app. 
 Agent: We're glad to hear about the improvement, Mark. We do not support any external audio devices at this stage, which may be why you're having trouble with bluetooth. We'll definitely pass along the interest, though. Let us know if we can assist further.

 Customer: Perhaps they need to know that! He was busy heading into the already full carriages 
 Agent: If First Class is declassified there will be announcement on-board to advise. Lewis

 Customer: How are you compensating affected customers? ? 
 Agent: Please follow this link to details on compensation in line with EU regulations: ^H

Customer: So I pay for Amazon Prime membership to get my delivery on a nominated day (yesterday) and they outsourced the delivery to Hermes so are now saying they can’t gaurentee it will be delivered on the day they specified. What exactly am I paying for please? ! 
 Agent: I'm so sorry your package is arriving later than expected! Sometimes carrier capacity or other unforeseen circumstances may all affect your delivery date. Have you been given a new delivery date? ^VF 
 Customer: Yes. It was supposed to be today and it hasn’t arrived. On the tracking it says there have been two delivery attempts but as I’ve been in my house and haven’t had a delivery or a card put through my door I know this isn’t true. 
 Customer: It’s nothing to do with capacity I expect the courier driver hasn’t actually attempted it or doesn’t know where he’s going. Not really acceptable though as I pay money for Prime solely because you promise a specified delivery day. 
 Agent: Thank you for confirming! Please contact us by phone or chat and we'll be happy to help investigate resolution options for you: Please keep us posted! We want to make sure this is fully resolved for you! 
 Customer: I’ve tried that. The people at your call centre told me that as it’s with the courier there is nothing they can do. 
 Agent: Hi, I am sorry to hear this. We strive to offer the best Black Friday and Cyber Week Deals. During this time, deliveries may take slightly longer than usual. What does the tracking currently say?. ^KK 
 Customer: This order was placed on the Thursday so I expect it would have been very quiet then actually. The delivery says it was attempted yesterday and today but it hasn’t been as I took a day off work to be home for it. It now says it will be redelivered Monday... when I’m back at work 
 Agent: Apologies, do you have unattended delivery preferences set on your account: 
 Customer: Well it’s irrelevant if they’re going to the wrong house...

Customer: Hi. Pe-ordered #StarWarsBattlefrontII at your Chichester store as the promo card said would receive #StarWarsTheLastJedi skins... 
 Customer: something's gone wrong somewhere? Can you help/advise? #StarWarsBattlefrontII #tesco #dissapointedsonafterschool 
 Customer:  
 Agent: Hi Shenman, they should be inside the packaging. Please contact the game creators. They should be able to advise further with it not being inside - Allyn 
 Customer: but as pre-order how would retailers know which product to hand out to pre-orders as all look same? @116089 @141157 can U shed light? 
 Customer: @116089 @141157 @127852 can you 'help'? 
 Agent: Hiya, having worked in a store myself, I can tell you that any pre-order games come in a separate delivery to the main stock we will sell. This is to avoid those who made a pre-order not getting the new game as soon as it is released. TY 
 Customer: thanks but I checked and they only had one version of the game. No distinction between pre order and regular stock? 
 Customer: so if I follow the logic here I was given the wrong copy? If your staff new nothing off the promotion (which they didn't) then they 
 Customer: may have been giving out the pre-order copies to people who were just buying the regular game? I'm not trying to be awkward 
 Customer: but I would just like what I was sold and what I actually paid in advance for. There must be some way of supplying your customers 
 Customer: correctly. I was told by staff in store that if you order via Direct they email the codes. So surely it must be possible for you to 
 Customer: supply them to me that way? It would be nice to think Tesco care about resolving things like this for their customers and doing 
 Customer: what is fair and correct. 
 Agent: Hi there, I've spoken to my Support Team to confirm, and they've advised that you would need to speak to EA. TY. - Mart

Customer: Holding for over an hour, @115722. 
 Agent: Not sure why you are on hold there but we are here for you. What's got you calling in? ^RMD 
 Customer: Can’t get service on the TV. Haven’t had it for weeks, but every time I call I ultimately hang up because I can’t get anyone on the line. 
 Agent: Oh no! Are there any lights on your box? What happens when you turn on the TV? 
 Customer: Pixelated picture, no sound, and the signal goes in and out. It’s unwatchable. 
 Agent: Is this happening on all the TVs? 
 Customer: We only have one. 😊 
 Agent: Is this any specific channel or all channels? ^RMD 
 Customer: All channels. 
 Agent: Disconnect the coax from the back of the box where it says FIOS TV IN, and then reconnect. Let us know if that helps. ^NHP 
 Customer: I don’t have a box, just local channels. 
 Customer: I think I am on hold now to cancel the service. They can’t seem to help me, and I’m paying for a service I’m not receiving.😢 
 Agent: We don't offer support unless you have a box. You can try swapping out the COAX cable screwed in, but we can't test anything. 
 Customer: Well, I’ve now been on trying to change services and they’re jerking me around. I’m going to lose my mind. This is my entire evening.
